# About Keane

Hi! I'm usually called _"Ke"_ for short.

- My fullname's (w/o middle initial) _"Keane Emanuel Dalisay"_.
- **I love to tender gardens**. I grow vegetables for self-sufficiency. It's nice to watch something slowly grow overtime from seed. Reaping fruits is the exciting part as it denotes your dedication to waiting for something to mature.
- **Cooking + baking** is what I also love doing. While I'm open to dining at resto's, it's quite different for me to cook a meal and have the freedom to include ingredients I like. This is why I'm also into experimenting which can make me produce either delightful or horrendous dishes.
- **Books!** While I do read technical books for knowledge (psychology, interface design), reading fiction is a fairly new hobby to me. I'm into themes that display the [warmth of human interaction](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/41015277-every-living-thing) and the resulting up/down moments which to navigate require thoughtful communication. I'm also open to mystery which could embed political or social constructs that I would like to think about.  

Below's a quote that's stuck to my mind.

> To be interesting, be interested. - [Dale Carnegie](https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/3317.Dale_Carnegie).

## Q&A
1. What is your level of expertise for Python Programming?
   > I'm [competent](https://www.rebeccawestburns.com/my-blog-3/notes/five-stages-of-acquiring-expertise-novice-to-expert) enough to program on my own. - Keane
2. Have you developed apps related to machine learning before?
   > Yes, but I'm an [advanced beginner](https://www.rebeccawestburns.com/my-blog-3/notes/five-stages-of-acquiring-expertise-novice-to-expert) in AI/ML. If I were to problem solve on my own, I would have to search it up which is a no no. I'm not profficient in high level math but I do recognize its importance for the field. - Keane
3. What are your expectations for this class.
   > It will be a springboard for the development of my team's thesis application. Plus, you'll technically be our co-adviser for the rest of the semester. ;-) - Keane
4. Any questions about the course?
   > For now, no. If there are, I will communicate with you by then. - Keane
