## About Me
>  Hi I'm Aaron, but you can call me _"ron"_ for short.
>  **I love Music**. I grew up with music. The first instrument I ever played was the violin. I like exploring different genres and streaming immersive albums. I taugh myself how to play the ukulele and I hope to start with an acoustic guitar soon. It'd be great if i could also be a part of a band in the future. 
>  **Math Nerd**. I love understanding abstract concepts in mathematics. I like the ecstasy of being able to solve problems on my own. I like how it all fits together perfectly and reveal truths about reality and beyond. It exists in a higher plane of existence and understanding it feels like a 6th sense.
> **PolSci/Law Student(?)** If I wasnt in the field of computer Science I'd be in Law School. My previous hobbies and extra curriculars were centered on debate and public speaking. I also had (still do) a keen interest in politics and philosophy.
